				<li class="rscadd">The bo staff will now always block any form of melee attack, similar to the riot shield, and has a 10% chance to knock the opponent out outright where previously it only stunned them on a 10% chance. It also fits in your backpack.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Xenofacility ruin has had some big additions, rooms have been moved around, the power grid is now powered by Pacmans instead of a backup SMES meaning scientists will have to occassionally check up on the pacmans every 20-30 minutes. The Flavor text has been dumbed down for the Scientists and new ways to interact with xenomorphs have been introduced and hinted to, more weapons added and weapons are now stored in one big area, every scientist gets a hardsuit now and due to a recent breakthrough in xenomorph communication 50 units of cardboard have been provided. There's a few other stuff as-well, scientists will have to explore the facility and get accustomed to the new stuff they have available to them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Removed more falsewalls that have managed to sit under the radar yet again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Goliath Mound now has much better loot for miners willing to brave it</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Watcher Spiral has less watchers and the chest no-longer gets pushed into lava</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Xeno Facility Atmos Problems should stop happening even if the observation windows get broken, if you notice it happening at all report it on the github or discord coder chat with @Stealthkibbler included in your message.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Xenomorph Larva now give a prompt when attempting to grab a ghost for bursting. If the prompt gets intrusive on your ghastly observing consider disabling the xenomorph pref. Thanks to Super and Cruix for supplying the code on this one <3</li>

				<li class="tweak">Bartenders spawn with zippo lighters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ashwalker Chitin Shoes no longer have armor values.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ashwalker Chitin Gauntlets have weaker armor values.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bone Bracers have even weaker armor values.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Telescience now respects areas that restrict teleportation</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Mining Medics spawn with optical health huds.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">matskuman5 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="tweak">You can now have multiple links awaiting approval at the same time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means you no longer have to wait the entire round for admins to notice your link before you can get a new one approved.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">monster860 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the lag. Cause of lag, IT'S THE GOD DAMN ACTION ICONS. Now, name off a few things you'd expect to cause lag: Atmos, large amounts of space carp, maybe having to process breathing and shit, maybe a loose singularity, but no. It's just action icons being ridiculously inefficient as fuck for literally no reason. This fix basically makes them not update their overlays every single tick.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The Syndicate now have a Xenomorph testing facility on Lavaland, the purpose of this is to tutor players on the dangers of xenos while also giving players the chance to play as the xenos and learn how they work.

				<li class="rscadd">There are 4 new mob themed ruins, a Weaver nest, Goliath Mound, Watcher Spiral and a Legion Barracks, each with their own basic theme and loot to plunder.  These are difficult ruins to raid and only experienced miners should attempt them.</li>

Health analyzers will alert you if your patient is having a heart attack. Analyzers will detect more gas types.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">This isn't really related to anything but did you know that if you give a slime morphine or frost oil it slows down, and you can become better friends with a slime by feeding it plasma? Or just order it to attack people by saying 'attack (person's full name.) Seriously, I was surprised to find a lot of this stuff out.</li>
